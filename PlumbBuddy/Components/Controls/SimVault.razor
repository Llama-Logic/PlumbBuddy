                    We're going to take a crack at improving that experience for players by teaching PlumbBuddy to monitor save files like it does mod files now, *but for a somewhat different purpose*. üòè<br />
                    Since *we are learning* about save files, though, we thought we could benefit from letting the wider creator community know about our intentions here. If any of you know a bit about save files and would like to pitch in or even just offer advice, your contributions are welcome.
